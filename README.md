# LightAlarm

#Overview

This Microbit project utilizes the onboard light sensor to create an interactive music and display experience. When the ambient light level surpasses a certain threshold (in this case, 100), the Microbit plays a delightful "POWER_UP" melody and displays a sad face. Conversely, when the light level is below the threshold, it showcases a happy face. This project combines both the auditory and visual aspects to engage users based on their surroundings.

#Features

Light sensor integration for ambient light detection
Musical feedback with the "POWER_UP" melody
Visual feedback with happy and sad face displays


#Requirements

Python
Microbit
